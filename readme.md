# My .files
These are my various dotfiles for configuring bash settings. The configurations
are created to work automatically in both debian and OSX". Running setup.sh
will test for and create symlinks for the various dotfiles included, all bash
files are sourced into .bash_profile. To ensure it is used in both login and
non-login shells, .bash_profile should be sourced into .bashrc.
